# Discovery Architectural Models
This is a maven project for searching for architectural models given a set of directories.
In the future the project will be also available for searching for a given httpURI for discovering models on the web.
The main files that we are looking for the moment are: **.aadl, .xmi and .ecore**

The main objective of this project is to convert all the previous models found into XMI format
in order to use MDE techniques for the future preprocessing.
